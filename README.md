<p className="flow-text">This is a very basic React+Redux Web Application that retrieves and displays 
                data for all champions in Teamfight Tactics (an online video game made by Riot Games).</p>
                <p className="flow-text">Redux is used to store the data that gets retrieved in the application. The application then uses the Redux store to retrieve the data.</p>
                <p className="flow-text">In the homepage is the table of all the champions in Teamfight Tactics.</p>
                <p className="flow-text">You can click on a champion to view detailed statistics about them.</p>
                <p className="flow-text">All data is pulled from the Riot Games API.</p>
