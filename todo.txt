make each champion in the table clickable

add a separate page system for each champion that is clicked on
 -> grab the data pulled from the API
 -> output the data on the pages with a readable format
connect the pages with the navigation/path display under the navbar
create a back button
reorganise footer; remove filler content and only show what is needed
if there's time, create a page system for origins and classes which may show the champions in those origins/classes
